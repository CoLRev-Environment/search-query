WOS_0005 — year-span-violation
==============================

**Error Code**: WOS_0005

**Message**: ``Year span must be five or less.``

**Problematic query**:

.. code-block:: text

    A AND PY=2000-2020

**Recommended query**:

.. code-block:: text

    A AND PY=2015-2020

**Typical fix**: The parser automatically adjusts the year span to 5 years.

.. note::
   **Deprecation Notice**: This linting rule is scheduled for deprecation.
   Recent evaluations show that the Web of Science (WOS) search interface
   does **not** enforce a 5-year publication range limit. Queries with
   broader year spans execute successfully, and applying the publication
   year filter manually yields identical results. Since no official WOS
   documentation supports the restriction, this rule will be removed in a
   future release.
