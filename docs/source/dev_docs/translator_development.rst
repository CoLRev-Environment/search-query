Translator
============

Translators convert between:

- Generic query syntax used in internal logic, and
- Specific query syntax required by a given search engine (e.g., PubMed, EBSCO, Web of Science).

Each translator implements `QueryTranslator`, the abstract base class from ``translator_base.py``.

Translator Responsibilities
---------------------------

A translator must implement the following two class methods:

- ``to_generic_syntax(query, *, field_general) -> Query``
- ``to_specific_syntax(query) -> Query``

Each method receives a `Query` object (the internal AST) and must return a new `Query` object with appropriately translated search fields and structure.

Utility Methods Provided
------------------------

From the base class (`QueryTranslator`), you can use:

- ``move_field_from_operator_to_terms(query)``:
  Moves a shared search field from the operator level to each child query.
- ``flatten_nested_operators(query)``:
  Merges nested logical operators of the same type into a flat structure.
- ``move_fields_to_operator(query)``:
  If all children have the same field, moves it to the parent node.

Search Field Mapping
--------------------

Field mapping is expected to be defined in a `constants_<source>.py` file and typically includes:

- ``syntax_str_to_generic_field_set()``: maps specific syntax string (e.g., `TI`, `AB`) to **set of generic `Fields`**. When the set contains multiple elements, the query must be extended with OR (see PubMed translator: ``_expand_combined_fields()``).
- ``generic_field_to_syntax_field()``: maps generic `Fields` to platform-specific syntax (set of fields). When combined fields are available, the query must be adapted before (see PubMed tranlsator: ``_combine_tiab()``).

Each translator should:

1. Translate fields in both directions
2. Handle combined fields (e.g., `[tiab]` in PubMed)
3. Optionally restructure the query for consistency

Advanced Features
-----------------

Some translators include advanced restructuring logic:

- **PubMed**: supports `[tiab]` expansion into OR combinations of `[ti]` and `[ab]`
