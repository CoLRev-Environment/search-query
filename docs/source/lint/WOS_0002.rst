WOS_0002 — near-distance-too-large
==================================

**Error Code**: WOS_0002

**Message**: ``NEAR distance is too large (max: 15).``

**Problematic query**:

.. code-block:: text

    TI=term1 NEAR/20 term2

**Recommended query**:

.. code-block:: text

    TI=term1 NEAR/15 term2

**Typical fix**: Reduce the NEAR distance to 15 or less.

.. note::
    **Deprecation Notice**: This linting rule is scheduled for deprecation. Recent evaluations show that the Web of Science (WOS) search interface does **not** enforce an upper range of 15 for the NEAR operator. Queries with broader NEAR distance execute successfully, and applying a NEAR operator with a range > 15 returns more records than 15. Since no official WOS documentation supports the restriction, this rule will be removed in a future release.
