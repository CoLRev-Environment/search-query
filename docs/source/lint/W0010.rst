W0010 â€” character-replacement
=============================

**Error Code**: W0010

**Message**: ``Character replacement``

**Scope**: PLATFORM.PUBMED

**Typical fix**: Be aware that certain characters like . in search terms will be replaced with whitespace due to platform-specific conversions. Specify search fields explicitly within the query instead of relying on general settings.

**Problematic query**:

.. code-block:: text

    "healthcare" AND "Industry 4.0"

**Correct query**:

.. code-block:: text

    "healthcare" AND "Industry 4 0"

**Back to**: :ref:`lint`
