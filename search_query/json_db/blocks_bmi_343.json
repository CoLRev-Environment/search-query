   "description": "original drafts by Sarah Dawson, Cochrane CCDAN group, 21 Jun 2016. TAU-filters may retrieve other comparative studies than RCTs, the comparison here being 'treatment as usual', in stead of placebo or gold standard therapy. See also 'no treatment'. For CINAHL the 'Treatment as usual'-filter is integrated in the RCT-filter.",
