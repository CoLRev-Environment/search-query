WOS_0005 — year-span-violation
==============================

**Error Code**: WOS_0005

**Message**: ``Year span must be five or less.``

**Problematic query**:

.. code-block:: text

    A AND PY=2000-2020

**Recommended query**:

.. code-block:: text

    A AND PY=2015-2020

**Typical fix**: The parser automatically adjusts the year span to 5 years.

.. note::
   **Deprecation Notice**: This linting rule is scheduled for deprecation.
   Recent evaluations show that the Web of Science (WOS) search interface
   does **not** enforce a 5-year publication range limit. Queries with
   broader year spans execute successfully, and applying the publication
   year filter manually yields identical results. The `WOS documentation <https://webofscience.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/26916347018257-Web-of-Science-Core-Collection-Advanced-Search-Field-Tags>`_
   mentions the five year limit, but it seems to be a recommendation rather
   than a strict limit.
