EBSCOHost
=========

EBSCOHost provides access to a wide range of academic databases across disciplines, including business, education, psychology, and health sciences.

Run a Query
-----------

EBSCOHost queries can be constructed using the standard `EBSCOHost advanced search interface <https://search.ebscohost.com/>`_ (requires institutional access).

When working with `search-query`, we recommend extracting the **Search terms** from the **Search History** panel or persistent URL for use as the `search_string`.

EBSCOHost query syntax includes field tags such as `AB`, `TI`, `SU`, etc. These should be included directly in the `search_string`.

Store a Query
-------------

When storing an EBSCOHost query in a `.json` file or as a string:

- Use the **Search History** or the **Search Terms** as the `search_string`.

.. tip::

   To ensure reproducibility, report the EBSCO database used (e.g., Business Source Complete) in the `database` field.

   Avoid setting a `general_field` (available in `Advanced Search`) unless the entire query targets the same field (e.g., all terms limited to `AB` for Abstract). Mixed fields should keep `general_field` empty.

   Do not use the **persistent link feature**.

List Query Format
--------------------

EBSCOhost supports building **multi-line queries** where individual components are defined as numbered search lines and later combined using references like ``S1 AND S2``. This method is often used in advanced or expert search modes.

List queries should be formatted as follows:

.. code-block:: json

   {
       "search_string": "1. TI (digital health OR telemedicine)\n2. AB (physical activity OR exercise)\n3. S1 AND S2",
       "general_field": ""
   }

Each numbered item defines a part of the query using EBSCOhost's field syntax. Later lines can combine them using boolean operators like ``AND``, ``OR``, or ``NOT``, allowing for structured, transparent query design.


Best Practices and Recommendations
----------------------------------

- **Use field tags** (e.g., `AB`, `TI`) explicitly in the query string.
- **Group nested queries** using parentheses to preserve logic.
