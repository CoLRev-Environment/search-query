**Search Query** is a Python package designed to **load**, **lint**, **translate**, **save**, **improve**, and **automate** academic literature search queries.
It is extensible and currently supports PubMed, EBSCOHost, and Web of Science.
The package can be used programmatically, through the command line, or as a pre-commit hook.
It has zero dependencies and integrates in a variety of environments.
The parsers and linters are battle-tested on peer-reviewed [searchRxiv](https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/journal/searchrxiv) queries.

For more information, see the [documentation](https://colrev-environment.github.io/search-query/).
